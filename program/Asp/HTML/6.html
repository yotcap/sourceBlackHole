    <h1>A Complete Web Site for Your School</h1>
    <p style=" font-size:18px;">        By following the instructions included here, you can build a complete web site for your school! This thing took me 4+ months to make, and lots of caffeine, so I expect some good ratings. There is lots of good stuff, even if you don't want the whole site. Impersonation, file access, database interfacing, automated Frontpage web administration, etc... Lots more than any other submission I've ever seen. Here's what's included: A full-fledged, all features included calendar system with publishing/subscription options, lunch menu, and personal calendars for everyday use The ability for every user to have their own personal web site (with your permission, of course) The ability for every club, department, and sports team to have their own site with calendar of events Document storage on a per-user basis so users can access their files from any web connected PC Integrated file manager (compatible with Internet Explorer 5 and up and Netscape 6 and up, other maybe) Built-in administration tools System relies on NT domain security for highest possible degree of integration with existing network
