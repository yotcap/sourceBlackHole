    <h1> [[Extreme Lock V. 2 [Fully] improved</h1>
    <p style=" font-size:18px;"> 
    <br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Compared to the Version 1 series. This one really improved. New User Interface. (THis is worth the download) Does NOT use Database. Instead this version created what is call a User Profile. in this user profile it stores the Username/Password in it. If you are running it for the first time. It will create a new profile after u type a password to go with your username. And username if none is supplied with your windows. So this one does not rely on your Username with your windows. Because it's locking System is SO advanced. It has this feature that if you Enter a password incorrect it will Give you a clue... With the first letter of your password... Eg. if My password is PSC the program will show on the Status message: "Username/Password incorrect (P**)" .. I took apart Version 1.0.1010 and rebuild it all over. It has it's complex codes, and the program itself is very easy to use... Adds a whole new security to windows.. Tabs, ALT+F4, CTRL+ALT+DEL will not prevent this program from being on TOP of the other applications and exiting with out a password...
