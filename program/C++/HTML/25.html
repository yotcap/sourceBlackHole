    <h1> Abware's SceneMax</h1>
    <p style=" font-size:18px;"> 
    <br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SceneMax is a new 3D scenes scripting language developed by me in order to let everyone the chance to create fast 3D video games with no effort at all!. The different between this engine and all the others i know is that here you can describe what you want in a very simple script instead of invoking the engine's API. The package contains the engine itself, integrated editor (although you can use any editor including ms-notepad) and a sample application called projector which is demonstaing how to use the engine and is used by the editor to test its scripts. After mastering the very simple commands you will be able to make stunning animations in no time and even integrate them into your own programs. The engine uses c++.net, directx9, ATL and STL to make the magic happens. The editor is a VB6 application based on my abware's PUMA application Also submitted to PSC and the projector is also a simple c++ win32 exe. Since i can't put all this stuff in PSC (because of the files size) i put here only the engine itself.
